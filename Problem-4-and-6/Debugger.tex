\section{Debugger}
I am using the inbuilt debugger from the Eclipse Oxygen IDE for debugging my code throughout and also testing my methods for accuracy and testing purpose. Eclipse debugger is the essential option to use as it is free and open source. Also since I have been using eclipse IDE for the better part of my student career, the familiarity to the eclipse debugger is another important reason for me to choose it.
\subsection{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is free and open source.
    \item It supports other languages as well other than JAVA.
    \item Functionalities like step into code/ step out of code and step over code are provided.
    \item There is option for framework integration like JUnit etc.
    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is usually slower than other debuggers like Visual studio.
    \item The independent processes cannot be attached to the eclipse debugger to debug and test.
\end{itemize}
