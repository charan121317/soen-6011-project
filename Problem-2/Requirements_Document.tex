\section{Requirements}
Following are the requirements for the Beta function:
$$\beta(x,y) =\int_{0}^{1} t^{x-1} (1-t)^{y-1} dt$$
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{R-1}: When the user enters the inputs,the function should check for the inputs as real positive integers only.
    \item \textbf{R-2}: When the user enters the inputs to the function, the function should evaluate the result as a real number in less than 4 seconds.
    \item \textbf{R-3}: When the user enters the inputs to the function, the functions should display the result as a real number in less than 4 seconds.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions}
There are following assumptions made for the class project for the Beta function:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{A-1}: The function will only accept the real positive numbers to limit the scope of the function.
    \item \textbf{A-2}: The function is assumed to return a result in not more than 4 seconds.
    
\end{itemize}
